    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "A reproducible paper is one in which every table and figure can be recreated by a reader or a reviewer from your data sets, using software on their own computer or using web-based tools.\n",
    "You may want to use a Jupyter notebook to write your next paper and make the entire document reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of the Python programming language and is familiar with using the terminal, and – if you wish to try this from scratch on your own computer – has the ability to install `pip` and `docker` on their computer.\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, however, you only need a browser and a stable internet connection.\n",
    "The document is made interactive thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).\n",
    "You can also optionally archive the reproducible version of your paper on Zenodo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To start with, choose to perform your analysis in [one of the programming languages supported by Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",
    "1. Create and launch a new Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "1. Enter your text in a “text cell”. You can also use LaTeX for any equations you want to include.\n",
    "1. Import your data in a “code cell”. You can store the data in the same folder as your notebook, or fetch data that was uploaded to Zenodo.\n",
    "1. Instead of preparing your tables and figures separately and placing them in your paper, include the code for each in a “code cell”. Then, “run” each code cell to generate the table or figure.\n",
    "1. When your paper is ready, upload the Jupyter notebook to a code-sharing platform like GitHub. Optionally, upload the file to Zenodo.\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions for Binder to allow your paper to be recreated in the cloud.\n",
    "1. Share the Binder link to your reproducible paper!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, using an experimental tool called “Jupyter Graffiti”, you can can watch a recording of this document in action right within it. <span class=\"graffiti-highlight graffiti-id_30kvwou-id_45kpgl6\"><i></i>Just click here!</span>"

    "\n",
    "You can install `jupyter` on your computer and create a notebook for your paper locally.\n",

    "Create a file called `requirements.txt` containing a list of the Python libraries to be used in your analysis.\n",
    "See [the file used in this tutorial](./requirements.txt).\n",
    "Save the file and then run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "repo2docker -E .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-E` flag stands for “editable” and tells `repo2docker` to allow any changes made in your browser to be written to the directory you are working in.\n",
    "The `.` means “current directory”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you run this command, `repo2docker` will build a “Docker container” with all of the software needed to run a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "However, once this container has been built once, the program will run faster on subsequent launches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some time after you run the above command, you will be presented with a URL in the same terminal window that you can copy and paste into a new browser tab.\n",
    "The Jupyter interface will greet you."
